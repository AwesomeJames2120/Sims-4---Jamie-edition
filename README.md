# Sims 4 - Jamie edition
A sims 4 modlist that somehow works with wabbajack

Note: This list is in very very very early stages, from what i've played of it its pretty damn stable but theres always issues with this kind of thing

If by the end of this experience you for some reason want to shove money down my throat, [my mouth is right here](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?business=EBWC5CYKDQK3E&no_recurring=0&item_name=I+do+stuff&currency_code=AUD)

Final important note: Mod organiser is a bitch and refuseds to work with sims 4 on anything other than my pc. Can you fix this? If yes show me and i will give you 5 entire dollars (australian). For now just copy and paste the mods folder that gets created in mo2 and shove it in your sims 4 mods folder in documents
# Pre installation
Due to the wonders of the sites people use to host sims 4 mods, a lot of them can't seem to actually be downloaded via wabbajack. Its cringe. Because of this, you will need to download the following manually, and place them in the folder that wabbajack will put the rest of the downloads in. (I may also be stupid, keep this in mind)

You will also need to run your sims 4 at least once so that the paths get set up correctly

# Actual Installation

Open the wabbajack file for this modlist, then set the paths for where you want the modlist installed, and the path to the folder containing the above files. The end result should look something like this![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44416823/178158104-e17e8c3f-389f-436a-9950-a5493881ca34.png)

Next, go hit the play button to the right. Assuming that we both didn't bugger this up, it should install correctly after downloading the mods its missing.

Once you're done, go to where you installed the list and open mod organiser, then scroll all the way down to the dlc section. In there you will see a bunch of mods that will not function (and *may* do something weird if you keep them installed without the dlc) if you dont have the expansion they're for. Simply disable them if this is the case.

# Manual mod installation

Any mod marked with a !before it is a mod that you will need to install manually, as their constant updating + not being on the nexus or loverslab makes stuff very difficult to update.

Grab the latest version from the following links and put them in their folders (marked with a !):

# Personal Taste

These mods arent needed but 

https://sacrificialmods.com/downloads.html - these are very stupid and not for everyone, but they are fun - install what looks cool to !sacrificial mods

https://wickedwhimsmod.com/download - install the sex animation packs you want from here

Your own stuff is where cool people like you put your custom content like cat ears and horrific looking shark teeth

# Running the game

After all that, you can click run at the top right and finally launch the game. However there is one last thing you will need to do first. In the options menu you will need to enable the custom content and custom scripts for stuff to actually work.

Once thats done, you're ready to start gaming. Direct any suggestions and issues to me via ping
